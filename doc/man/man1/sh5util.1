.SH "NAME"
.LP
sh5util \- Tool for merging HDF5 files from the acct_gather_profile
plugin that gathers detailed data for jobs running under SLURM

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP
sh5util

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
sh5util merges HDF5 files produced on each node for each step of a job into
one HDF5 file for the job. The resulting file can be viewed and manipulated
by common HDF5 tools such as HDF5View, h5dump, h5edit, or h5ls.
.LP
sh5util also has an extract mode that writes a limited set of
data for specific nodes, steps, and data series in
"comma separated value" form to a file which can be imported into other
analysis tools such as spreadsheets.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fIpath\fR

.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-node\fR=\fInodename\fR
Node name to extract (default is all)

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-level\fR=\fI[Node:Totals|Node:TimeSeries]\fR

Name=Specific Name, Tasks=all tasks, (default is everything)
.RE

.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR=\fI<job(.step)>\fR
Format is <job(.step)>. Merge this job/step
(or a comma-separated list of job steps). This option is required.
Not specifying a step will result in all steps found to be processed.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this description of use.

.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIpath\fR
.nf

Default for merge is ./job_$jobid.h5
Default for extract is ./extract_$jobid.csv
.fi

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-profiledir\fR=\fIdir\fR
Directory location where node-step files exist default is set in
acct_gather.conf.

.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-savefiles\fR
